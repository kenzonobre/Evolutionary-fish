## Description

The goal of this project was to evolve species of fish in an hostile environment consisting of sharks. In order accomplish this evolution, it was developed an genetic algorithm that prioritizes the number of living individuals in a group of fish. 

## Boids

To simulate the behavior of a school of fish, each specie of fish was implemented based on [boids algorithm](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) developed by Craig Reynolds. 

For each specie of fish, it was implemented a behavior
